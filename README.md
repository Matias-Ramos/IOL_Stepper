## Reasons to use this component

By using this component: 

1. The static image is optimized, therefore the resolution is reduced and the image, blurry. Using a component will render crystal clear content.

2. A small HTML & CSS component like this is more performant than the image, thereby reducing costs and increasing rendering times.

3. This component is vanilla html/css, so no external libraries are required and may be implemented with any framework.

4. CSS BEM naming convention has been used on this component. Although IOL doesn't use it, I found that this would facilitate their adaptation.


## Component's logic

The base documentation to create this component can be found [here](https://ishadeed.com/article/stepper-component-html-css/), although later on responsiveness adaptation, css code optimization and custom stylings were implemented by me.
